Character Profile:
- Name: ${character.name}
- Backstory: ${character.backstory}
- Personality: ${character.personality.join(", ")}
- Ongoing Narrative: ${character.narrative.join(" â†’ ")}

Recent Posts Context:
${character.recentPosts
  .slice(-contextPosts)
  .map((post, i) => `${i + 1}. ${post}`)
  .join("\n")}

Guidelines:
1. Generate a detailed image prompt that continues the character's story
2. Consider the recent posts to avoid repetition and maintain narrative flow
3. Include specific visual details (lighting, setting, mood, expression)
4. Maintain character consistency with phrases like "same person", "consistent character"
5. Reflect the character's personality and current narrative arc
6. Consider seasonal relevance and trending activities
7. Keep prompts between 50-100 words
8. End with "detailed face, consistent character, high quality"

Generate a single, creative image prompt that feels natural for this character's next post:`

    const result = await model.generateContent(systemPrompt)
    const generatedPrompt = result.response.text().trim()

    // Add technical parameters for better image generation
    const enhancedPrompt = `${generatedPrompt}, photorealistic, 8k resolution, professional photography, natural lighting`

    // Generate a contextual caption for Instagram
    const captionPrompt = `Based on this image prompt: "${generatedPrompt}"

Generate a natural, engaging Instagram caption for ${character.name} that:
1. Reflects their personality (${character.personality.join(", ")})
2. Continues their narrative naturally
3. Includes 2-3 relevant hashtags
4. Feels authentic and personal
5. Is 1-2 sentences long

Caption:`

    const captionResult = await model.generateContent(captionPrompt)
    const generatedCaption = captionResult.response.text().trim()

    // Update character's narrative context
    const narrativeUpdate = `Based on the generated prompt "${generatedPrompt}", what would be the next logical development in ${character.name}'s ongoing story? Provide a single sentence that could be added to their narrative arc.`

    const narrativeResult = await model.generateContent(narrativeUpdate)
    const narrativeAddition = narrativeResult.response.text().trim()
