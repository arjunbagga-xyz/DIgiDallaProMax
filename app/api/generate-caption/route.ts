      5.  Do not use hashtags that are just the character's name or trigger words.
      6.  Do not include any of your own commentary. Just provide the caption.

    const result = await model.generateContent(generationPrompt)
    const response = await result.response
    const caption = response.text()

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to generate caption:", error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to generate caption" }, { status: 500 })
