### 5. Deploy
Choose your deployment strategy:

**Local + Cloud Hybrid (Recommended):**
```bash
# Start local scheduler
npm run start:scheduler

# Deploy to GitHub Actions as backup
npm run deploy:github
```

**Local Only:**
```bash
# Start ComfyUI
python ComfyUI/main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188

npm run start:scheduler
```

**Cloud Only:**
```bash
# Deploy to GitHub Actions
npm run deploy:github
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database System

The application uses a simple and effective file-based database system. All data is stored in JSON files within the `data/` directory. This approach is lightweight, easy to manage, and fits perfectly with the zero-cost deployment model.

### `data/characters.json`

This is the core database file, storing an array of character objects. Each object contains all the information needed to define a character, including their personality, API keys, and settings.

**Example `character` object:**

```json
{
  "id": "char_1754528276811_4suaz8mqv",
  "name": "Luna the Mystic",
  "personality": "Dreamy and mystical",
  "backstory": "Luna is a mysterious character who lives in a hidden forest.",
  "instagramHandle": "@luna_mystic",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-08-07T00:57:56.811Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-08-08T10:30:00.000Z",
  "preferredModel": "sdxl_dreamshaper.safetensors",
  "triggerWord": "luna_character",
  "promptSettings": {
    "basePrompt": "a beautiful portrait of luna_character",

  },
  "narratives": [
    {
      "id": "narr_1",
      "title": "The Crystal Quest",
      "description": "Luna is searching for a legendary crystal.",
      "startDate": "2025-08-01",
      "endDate": "2025-08-31"
    }
  ],
  "instagramAccountId": "1234567890",
  "instagramApiKey": "INSTAGRAM_API_KEY",
  "twitterAccountId": "0987654321",
  "twitterAppKey": "TWITTER_APP_KEY",
  "twitterAppSecret": "TWITTER_APP_SECRET",
  "twitterAccessToken": "TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "twitterAccessSecret": "TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET"
}
```

### `data/scheduler.json`

This file stores an array of scheduled task objects, defining what actions should be taken and when.

**Example `task` object:**

```json
{
  "id": "task_1",
  "characterId": "char_1754528276811_4suaz8mqv",
  "type": "generate_and_post",
  "schedule": "0 18 * * *",
  "active": true,
  "config": {
    "prompt": "luna_character in a magical forest",
    "postToInstagram": true
  }
}
```

### `data/prompts.json`

This file stores an array of generated prompt objects, which can be used for generating images and captions.

**Example `prompt` object:**

```json
{
  "id": "prompt_1",
  "characterId": "char_1754528276811_4suaz8mqv",
  "characterName": "Luna the Mystic",
  "prompt": "a beautiful portrait of luna_character in a magical forest",
  "caption": "Exploring the enchanted woods today! #magic #forest #luna",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-08T11:00:00.000Z",
  "used": false
}
```
